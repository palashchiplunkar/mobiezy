            <h1>Cookies</h1>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly
                used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
                browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
                device's internal memory. This Service does not use these
                “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code
                and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and
                improve their services. You have the option to either accept or
                refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to
                your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be
                able to use some portions of this Service.

            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information

                personally identifiable information through the Application
                and/or Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to
                monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this
                Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally
                identifiable information through the Application and/or Services
                without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
                child has provided personally identifiable information to us
                through the Application and/or Services, please contact us. You
                must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the
                processing of your personally identifiable information in your
                country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian
                to do so on your behalf).
